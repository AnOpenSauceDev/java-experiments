# Demos of the thing!

(i have rendered a few more demos, such as Virtual Insanity, unfortunately i cannot share them here due to copyright and all that legal stuff.)
Vector Games, such as Vib-Ribbon don't look all that good with Canny and Sobel.
Thin lines, such as drawings and anime, tend to look much better using Canny, while Sobel looks better with real-life things.
Pixel art using canny is... salvageable, but transpearancy leaves ghosting artifacts
